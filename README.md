# hello-world
A short test repository

This is a short description about myself. I am 17, attend highschool in the Bay Area, and am passionate about art, engineering, and many other things. I am a conisseur of yogurt and granola, and could eat cereal every meal for the rest of my life - well, maybe with a plate or two of spaghetti thrown in every so often.
